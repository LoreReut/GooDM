A tool I made for my group of friends for the tabletop RPG Shadowrun.

You can:

- Create, save & load NPCs and PCs as well as modify all their stats relevant to combat
- Have the program handle all related to combat turns & initiative so you can focus on roleplaying
- Roll the die for your NPCs so you don't have to fill your table with dice (unless you're into that sort of stuff)
